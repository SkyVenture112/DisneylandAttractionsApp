# DisneylandAttractionsApp
 
A fun project I've been working on to more thoroughly learn Jetpack Compose and Android app development. The app catalogues a list of current Disneyland attractions, and users are able to browse and filter through them.
It also implements the Queue Times API using Retrofit to display current attraction wait times and statuses.
